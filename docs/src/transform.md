# Transform

`Transform` is the object that takes care of transforming the input data before distances are being computed. It can be as standard as `IdentityTransform` returning the same input, or multiplying the data by a scalar with `ScaleTransform` or by a vector with `ARDTransform`.
There is a more general `Transform`: `FunctionTransform` that uses a function and apply it on each vector via `mapslices`.
You can also create a pipeline of `Transform` via `TransformChain`. For example `LowRankTransform(rand(10,5))âˆ˜ScaleTransform(2.0)`.

One apply a transformation on a matrix or a vector via `KernelFunctions.apply(t::Transform,v::AbstractVecOrMat)`
